For a phenotype of interest, we have collected the marginal statistics for M = 4268 SNPs and the M × M LD matrix R (i.e., pairwise SNP-SNP Pearson correlation). The marginal statistics are based on N = 1000 individuals. Download the marginal statistics and LD matrix from here:

For this question, you may also assume there is no population stratiﬁcation in this dataset. Both phenotype and genotype were standardized.

Implement the very basic LD score regression algorithm with a programming language of your choice (preferably Python or R) to estimate the heritability of the phenotype.
